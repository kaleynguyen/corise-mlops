        "* Dataset labels can be noisy as they are collected from a variety of different sources.\n",

        "[Great Expectations](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/) is a popular Python library for validating data in Machine Learning pipelines. It contains several built-in Expectation types to configure tests, as well as integrations with common data structures used to store datasets (e.g. Pandas dataframes, CSV files, MySQL databases etc). We will be using this library to define and run some data quality tests for our dataset. The goal and scope of the exercise here is to get you acquainted with the library and practice of testing for data quality.\n",
